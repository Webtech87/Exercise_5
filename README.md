ðŸ§© Exercise: Group Words by Length

Task:

Given a list of words, group them by their length. Return a dictionary where the key is the length of the word, and the value is a list of all words with that length.

Hint:
* For each word, calculate its length using len(word).
* Use the length as the key in the dictionary.
* If the key already exists, append the word to the list. If not, create a new list.
